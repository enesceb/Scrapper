# Meshcapade Data Scraper

## Overview
This is a professional data scraping solution for extracting measurement data from the Meshcapade platform (me.meshcapade.com). The scraper is designed to collect anthropometric measurements from the editor page and systematically store them in a SQLite database.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Automated Data Collection**: Systematically increments height values from 150cm to 200cm
- **Real-time Measurement Capture**: Captures all body measurements as the system calculates them
- **Database Storage**: Stores all collected data in a SQLite database for analysis
- **Stealth Technology**: Uses advanced browser automation techniques to bypass bot protection

### Technical Specifications
- **Platform**: .NET 8.0 / C#
- **Browser Automation**: Microsoft Playwright
- **Database**: SQLite with Entity Framework Core
- **Data Points**: 51 measurement sets (150cm-200cm height range)
- **Measurements Captured**: Height, Weight, Chest, Waist, Hip, Inseam, and additional body measurements

## Architecture

### Components
1. **UltraStealthManualScraper**: Main scraping engine with anti-bot protection
2. **MeasurementData**: Data model for storing anthropometric measurements
3. **MeshcapadeDbContext**: Database context for data persistence
4. **ScrapingConfig**: Configuration management

### Data Model
```csharp
public class MeasurementData
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
    public decimal Height { get; set; }
    public decimal Weight { get; set; }
    public decimal Chest { get; set; }
    public decimal Waist { get; set; }
    public decimal Hip { get; set; }
    public decimal Inseam { get; set; }
    public string Notes { get; set; }
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Modern web browser (Chrome recommended)
- Internet connection

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project
2. Restore NuGet packages:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

### Usage
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions for manual assistance
3. Open an incognito browser tab when prompted
4. Navigate to https://me.meshcapade.com/editor
5. Wait for the page to load completely
6. Press ENTER in the console to start automated data collection

## Manual Assistance Process

Due to the website's bot protection mechanisms, the scraper requires human assistance to establish the initial connection:

1. **Wait Phase**: Allow 10 seconds for bot detection to settle
2. **Browser Setup**: Open a new incognito tab
3. **Navigation**: Navigate to the Meshcapade editor page
4. **Verification**: Ensure measurement controls are visible
5. **Trigger**: Press ENTER to start automated collection

## Data Collection Process

Once initiated, the scraper will:
1. Focus on the height input field
2. Set height value incrementally (150cm â†’ 200cm)
3. Trigger system calculations
4. Capture all measurement values
5. Store data in SQLite database
6. Log progress and results

## Database Access

The collected data is stored in `meshcapade_data.db`. You can access it using:

### SQLite Command Line
```bash
sqlite3 meshcapade_data.db
.tables
SELECT * FROM MeasurementData LIMIT 10;
```

### View Data Summary
```sql
SELECT Height, Weight, Chest, Waist, Hip 
FROM MeasurementData 
ORDER BY Height;
```

## Output Files

The scraper generates several output files:
- `meshcapade_data.db`: SQLite database with all measurement data
- `editor_results.html`: Captured HTML content from the editor page
- `editor_results.png`: Screenshot of the editor page
- `logs/`: Application logs (if enabled)

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "ScrapingConfig": {
    "UserAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36",
    "WaitTimeMs": 2000,
    "MaxRetries": 3
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Bot Protection**: If the site detects automation, try waiting longer between actions
- **Page Loading**: Ensure the page is fully loaded before starting collection
- **Database Access**: Check file permissions if database operations fail
